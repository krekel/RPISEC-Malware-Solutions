1. Main Function
	a. What is the address of main?
	sub_4011A0
	b. What does this function do?
	    The function checks if it can establish a connection to an url
		i. What code constructs are used in this function?
			An if statement is used to check if an internet connection can be made. If the

2. (15%) Looking at the subroutine a 0x00401130:
	a. What are the arguments to InternetConnectA? What do they mean?
		hInternet: handle returned by a previous call to InternetOpen
		lpszServerName: reversing.rocks : hostname
		nServerPort: 1234 : Port used
		lpszUserName: null
		lpszPassword: null
		dwService: HTTP : Service to access
		dwFlags: null
		dwContext: null
	b. What does this function do?
		Initializes WinInet functions. Establishes an HTTP session to reversing.rocks at port 1234. Passes
		the created handle as an argument to sub_401000 if the session was established successfully. If not,
		it exits.

		i. What code constructs are used in this function?
			If statements
3. (10%) Looking at the subroutine at 0x00401000:
	a. What code constructs are used in this function?
		Loops and if statemtents
	b. What imported functions are called?
		FindFirstFileA, HttpOpenRequestA, HttpSendRequestExA, InternetWriteFile, FindNextFileA,
		HttpEndRequestA, InternetCloseHandle, FindClose
	c. What does this subroutine do?
		Loops through every file that matches '\*' and sends them through and HTTP POST request
4. (15%) What does this malware do?Lab_02­2.malware
	Establishes a connection to a malicious website and sends files from the victim's computer to the malicious 
	server.


1. (15%) Main function:
	a. What imported functions are called?
		i. What do these functions do?
			AllocConsole: Allocates a console for the calling process
			FindWindow: Retrieves a handle to the top level window with the specified ClassName
			ShowWindow: Displays the console window
			fopen: Opens a file 
			fputs: writes to a stream
			ctime 
		ii. Any interesting strings?
			\\WINDOWS\\lzwindowlz.av
			Started loggin:
2. (15%) Looking at the subroutine at 0x0040135C:
	a. What imported functions are called?
		GetAsyncState
		The other functions are c standard function used for writing to files
	b. What code constructs are used here?
		Switch statement
	Hint: Look at the ‘jmp eax’ at 0x00401465, try to guess where that jump could potentially
	take you
3. (20%) What does this malware do?
	It is a keylogger. It stores the logged keys in a file and after a certain amount of keystrokes logged, it sends an email to the malicious actor.
	a. What signatures would you propose?
		GetAsyncKeyState
		i. Why are they useful signatures?
			KeyLoggers use this function to know when keys are being pressed without the user knowing it. Since it does not display any kind of console or gui element.  
		ii. Does the sample create any files? If so, what are they used for?. What does this function do?
			The sample creates the following file: \\WINDOWS\lzwindowlz.av
			The file is used to log the pressed keys.
		
		Keypresses are recorded and stored in \\WINDOWS\\lzwindowlz.av. Every 100 characters the file is sent to the malicious actor via email. Special characters are replaced with brackets and their name. ([BACKSPACE])

Lab 03 ­ Analyzing Windows Programs

# Lab\_03­1.malware

Shiela from marketing has been complaining about random popups. She claims she didn&#39;t do anything but we think she clicked on another &quot;link&quot; in her email again. Can you find out if we need to be worried?

** **

1. (1 pts) Did you find any interesting resources? If so, how did you extract it?

	One interesting resource was found. IDR_DLL1, a dll.
	The resource was extracted using ResourceHacker

1. (3 pts) List at least 3 imports or sets of imports. What is their purpose (from msdn), and how might the malware use them?

	LoadResource: loads the dll from the resource section.
	WriteFile: Once the dll is loaded from the resource section, the malware writes the dll on the victim's machine.
	IsDebuggerPresent: Anti debugging technique to slow down the analysis process.

1. (3 pts) List at least 3 strings that stick out to you and describe how they might relate to malicious activity.
	
	regsvr32 /s C:\\Windows\\atidvr.dll: register the dll as a command component in the registry. 
	http://rpis.ec/ - one of few potential network signatures found
	C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads\BHOinCPP_src\BHOinCPP\Release\BHOinCPP.pbd: It seems that it is a project hosted at codeproject.com


1. (3 pts) What persistence mechanism is used by this malware? What host­based signatures can you gather from this?

	regsvr32 -> Registers the dll loaded with regsvr32 /s C:\\Windows\\atidvr.dll
	
	CLSID\{3543619C-D563-43f7-95EA-4DA7E1CC396A}\InProcServer32
	Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Browser Helper Objects\{3543619C-D563-43f7-95EA-4DA7E1CC396A}
	
** **

1. (2 pts) What is the CLSID served by this malware?

	CLSID\{3543619C-D563-43f7-95EA-4DA7E1CC396A}	

1. (2 pts) What is the name of the COM interface that this malware makes use of?
	
	IWebBrowser2

1. (2 pts) What two COM functions does this malware call from the above COM interface, and what are they used for? (hint: check the PMA book)

	put_Visible: shows the windows explorer instance
	Navigate: Navigates to a resource identified by an url.
	
	It chooses one of the few rpisec urls to use in adware

# Lab\_03­2.malware

The networking guys noticed a bunch of weird activity coming from a box on your network and had IT do an in­depth scan. This was the only file of interest, what can you tell us?

# Basic Analysis

1. (1 pts) What is the md5sum? What of interest does VirusTotal Report?
	
	bf4f5b4ff7ed9c7275496c07f9836028
	Makes a request to us.t28.net
	Writes a file to C:\Users\Administrator\java.exe
	Shell command execution	

1. (3 pts) List at least 3 imports or sets of imports you haven&#39;t seen before, what is their purpose (from msdn), and how might the malware use them.

# Advanced Analysis

The networking guys gave you some more information about the traffic that tipped them off. They were able to extrapolate from the traffic and identify some functionality they want you to look into. Answer the following questions (5­8) for each of the functions identified by the networking team.

Identified functionality

        ∙List processes, interactive remote shell, upload file (from infected machine)

1. (1 pts) What is the address of the subroutine that handles this functionality?

1. (1 pts) What is the command ID? It will help the networking guys group the traffic.

1. (1pts) Does the subroutine return anything to the attacker, if so, what?

1. (3 pts) Name 3 Windows API calls used and how they contribute to the functionality. **(send/recv don&#39;t count!)**

1. (3 pts) Did the networking guys miss anything? Briefly name/describe 3 more functionalities offered by the malware. Provide the command IDs.
